## Playtest and Reflect

Swap with a neighbor and play each other's complete games.

**Give feedback on:**
- Is it clear what to do on the start screen?
- Does the score feel meaningful?
- Is the game over clear — do you know why you lost?

---

**Reflect on your own work:**

The `global` keyword was probably the most confusing part of this lesson. In your own words, why do you need it?

> *[TODO: insert free-text-auto assessment — "Explain why the global keyword is needed when a function changes a variable. Use an example from your game."]*
