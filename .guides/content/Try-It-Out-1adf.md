## Try It Out

Hit **Run** to start `track.py`.

This game has three states: a start screen, the game itself, and a game over screen. Play through the whole cycle.

**Notice:**
- How do you start the game? How do you restart it?
- Where does the score display?
- What triggers the game over?

Now look at the code. Find the `state` variable and the three places it gets checked: in `draw()`, `update()`, and `on_key_down`.
