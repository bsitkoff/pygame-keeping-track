## Create Your Own

> 📹 **Watch:** Game States
> *Record in Screencastify — state = 'start'/'playing'/'game_over'; how state controls draw() and update()*
> *Objective: I can use a state variable to control what draws and what updates.*
> **[ADD VIDEO URL WHEN RECORDED]**

---

Build a complete game with states in `tryit.py`.

### 🖼️ Using Your Own Sprite

*Need a custom image? Here's the workflow — or rewatch the video from Lesson 1.*

1. Find an image that's **at least 80×80 pixels**
2. Open **[Squoosh](https://squoosh.app)**, resize to about 80×80, and download *(Squoosh can make images smaller but not larger — start with a big enough image!)*
3. Upload the file to your `images/` folder in Codio
4. Update the `Actor('name')` in your code to match the filename (no `.png`)

### Requirements

Build a game in `tryit.py` that:

1. Has a **start screen** that waits for a keypress before the game begins
2. Has a **playing state** with a moving player, at least one enemy, and a collectible
3. **Tracks and displays a score** while playing
4. Has a **game over screen** that shows the score and lets you restart
5. Uses **your own sprites**

> *[TODO: insert LLM rubric autograder — 5 rubric items matching requirements above]*

---

If you finish early: add a high score that persists across restarts.
